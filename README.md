I am a graduated physicist (M.Sc. at KIT, 2024) particularly interested in **software development** and **data science**.
The main subjects of my studies were *astroparticle* and *theoretical particle physics*.
I speak *English*, *German*, and a little bit of *Spanish*.

### Programming experience

- **Python** (*advanced*):
  - published package [pkgcreator](https://github.com/PhilippMeder/pkgcreator)
  - developed a python framework for my Master's Thesis  
  - a lot of unpublished private projects
- **Fortran** (*basic*): used for my Bachelor's Thesis
- **C++** (*basic*): basic knowledge from university lectures

In addition, my minor subjects at university were **computer science** (including a lecture in **software development**) and **optimisation theory**.
